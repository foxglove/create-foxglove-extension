## _A Foxglove Studio Extension_

This is a simple [Foxglove Studio](http://foxglove.dev/studio) extension panel that demonstrates
embedding the [Monaco Code Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) in a Foxglove Studio
Extension panel.

Note that this uses the [Monaco React](https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-react) wrapper which
relies on a CDN distribution of the Monaco editor so it will not work offline.
